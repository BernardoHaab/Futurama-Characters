# 💡 What I Learned

* **Webpack and Babel:** As much as I've been using Webpack and Babel with React, this is the first time I've set them up from scratch.
* **Js Classes:** Classes in JavaScript end up in a similar situation because, as much as I've used them during development with EmberJs, it's the first time I've developed for VanillaJs with them.
